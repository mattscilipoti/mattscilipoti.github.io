Moonshine and Rails3 sitting in a tree...

As of today, moonshine is working nicely with Rails3 and Bundler 1.0.  Whew!  

h2.  "Mooonsine":http://github.com/railsmachine/moonshine

bq.  Rails deployment and configuration management done right. 
ShadowPuppet + Capistrano == crazy delicious

I don't know about you, but I missed the friendly voice of moonshine, "let me handle this provisioning and deployment for you, sir."

Kudos go out to Josh (technicalpickles) and Rails Machine!  He is wrapping up the last bits as this goes to press.



Thanks!
